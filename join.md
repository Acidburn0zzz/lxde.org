Join the LXDE community and become part of an exciting project. The LXDE team
welcomes contributors and supporters to the project! Become a developer, a
documentation writer, packaging maintainer, tester, user supporter, blogger,
journalist writing about LXDE or organize events and present LXDE. Join and
help us to develop the fastest and most engery efficient system and get it out
to everyone. Please, see the following for some ideas. We are looking forward
to keeping in touch with you.

#### Get LXDE and try it out

The first step of joining is always to download the software and try it out.

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="/get" class="button special">Get LXDE</a></li>
</ul>

If you fancy for a single-board computer, there are many boards (for example,
Raspberry Pi) using LXDE as their default desktop environment.  If it doesn't,
you can still try to install it by yourself, or with the help of the community.

#### Test LXDE

Users are not only consumer. We believe users can be valuable contributors by
using and testing LXDE and by offering their feedback. We invite you to test
components from LXDE subversion for bugs. Please check out the bug tracking
system at Sourceforge and start testing LXDE.

#### Translate LXDE and the projects documentation

Do you speak more than one language? LXDE is 100% volunteer translated, which
means you can be part of the LXDE translation project translating the software
and documentation thousands of people will use. Please visit the links below
for detailed information:

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/lxde-i18n" class="button">Mailing List</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.lxde.org/en/Category:Translations" class="button">Wiki Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://forum.lxde.org/viewforum.php?f=12" class="button">Forum Board</a></li>
</ul>

An easy way to join translation is also to start translating wiki pages. Check
out the wiki in your language at http://wiki.lxde.org . If your language is not
listed yet and you would like to be a maintainer of wiki content, please
contact us us and we will set up a wiki in your language.

#### Become a Developer and Submit Patches/Code Contributions

LXDE is a Free and Open Source project started in Taiwan in 2005 with the
publication of the first component PCManFM. We are excited to join up and work
together with people from all over the world. If you see a bug in the
bug-tracker that you can fix, let us know and then go for it! All the
information you need to checkout LXDE is on our Sourceforge pages.

**[TODO: check what page should we refer to. GitHub?]**

#### Become a LXDE Designer

Open Source means everyone can get involved - not only developers. Check out
the LXDE design and browse the project page at sourceforge. Join us at the LXDE
Design Project.

LXDE blogs are written by developers, contributors, volunteers, and staff of
companies supporting LXDE — stay up on LXDE related progress and news and start
to get involved. For example on our wiki we are putting together a resource
with solutions to common problems, how-to's, and other helpful information.
Check out the resources on the LXDE websites and start contributing yourself:

performs well on energy saving computers such as mobile devices and other low

many people in their lives. Support the community and promote LXDE. Write about
LXDE on your blog, in forums, in your local community zine, in newspapers or
simply tell others about it.

#### Support LXDE at Community Events

Set up a booth or a table about LXDE at open source community events! There are
many events of the open source community all over the world. The core team of

events, set up a LXDE info point and showcase LXDE.
