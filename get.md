#### I want to buy a low-budget computer with LXDE

If you want to buy a computer, you can consider getting a single-board computer
for a fraction of the price.  Many single-board computers preloaded LXDE as
their default desktop environment.

You could also consider getting a computer from a local computer recyclers and
ask them to install Lubuntu on it.

Although it could run on the computers with RAM as small as 256MiB, We
recommend getting a computer with RAM of 1GiB or above for applications running
on it, such as web browser, video player and office suite.
